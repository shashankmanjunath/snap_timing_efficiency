    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In American football, pre-snap motion is intended to either create advantageous matchups for offensive players, or to confuse the defense in the defense by putting an offensive player in an unexpected spot. These motions can be used to draw defenders away from the point of attack, to allow larger or faster receivers to get matchups on smaller defenders, or any other myriad of advantages one could exploit to gain positive yards on offense. However, at some point in a pre-snap motion, there is *maximal* confusion or advantage for the offense against the defense. Maybe this is right as a receiver is being handed off from one player to another in a zone defense concept, or maybe this is right when a defensive player realizes that their assigned receiver is in motion in a man defense concept. We want to measure how good teams are at exploiting this moment of maximal confusion using the timing of the snap."

    "## Snap Timing Efficiency Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop a novel metric, Snap Timing Efficiency (STE), to analyze how our well teams time their snap with their pre-snap motion on passing plays.\n",
    "[Inspired by prior work](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-new-metric-shows-how-good-nfl-receivers-are-at-creating-separation/), we aim to quantify how \"confusion\" leads to offensive yards by measuring receiver separation from closest defender at the time of ball arrival to the receiver [1].\n",
    "We predict separation using an XGBoost model using only information known to the offense prior to the snap, such as play direction, route depth, defensive alignment, offensive formation, route type, route depth, and \"break\" in the route after the ball is thrown.\n",
    "We additionally use the targeted receiver's position, speed and direction as the ball is snapped. \n",
    "However, when testing this metric, we can use the player's position and direction throughout their motion, and even simulate their position and direction after their motion to predict Using this metric, we can predict a receiver's separation based on their pre-snap position."

    "### Metric Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have predicted the receiver's position at all pre-snap positions, we can calculate the difference in final prediction between the \"optimal\" position, which is the maximum predicted separation.\n",
    "Since we use only single timepoints from the targeted receiver for prediction, we predict the separation at each time point using our XGBoost model.\n",
    "We can therefore analyze the difference between the \"optimal\" time (where separation was predicted to be maximized) as compared to the actualy snap time using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{STE} = \\left(\\frac{s_\\text{snap}}{s_\\text{max}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{t_\\text{max} + 1}{t_\\text{snap} + 1}\\right)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $s_\\text{max}$ is the maximum separation, $s_\\text{snap}$ is predicted separation at time of snap, $t_\\text{snap}$ is the time of snap in seconds, and $t_\\text{max}$ is the time of maximum predicted separation. This metric ranges from 0 to 1, and has several desirable properties. When our snap time is close to maximum separation time and predicted snap separation is close to optimal (maximum) snap separation, STE is close to 1. Note that $s_\\text{max} \\geq s_\\text{snap}$ and $t_\\text{snap}  \\geq t_text{max}$, so the maximum value of $STE$ is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when the maximum predicted snap separation is much higher than the predicted separation at snap time and the the snap time is far from the optimal snap time, i.e. snap time when separation is maximized, we STE is small, close to zero. However, due to practical limits in this dataset, the minimum observed value is 0.0009 by **TODO team**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply a 3-step windowed moving average filter (low pass filter) to remove some of the high-frequency noise in the predictions caused by small fluctuations in the data rather than true variation in the resulting separation before calculating $s_\\text{max}$, $s_\\text{snap}$, $t_\\text{max}$, and $t_\\text{min}$. Additionally, we only calculate STE if there are at least 5 valid \"frames\" between line set and play snap."
